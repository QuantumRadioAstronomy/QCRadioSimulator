# QCRadioSimulator
A simple source identification pipeline with simulated quantum images.

# Example
![Mock source identification test with QPIE for a N × N = 32 × 32 pixel image. Five point sources are convolved with a Gaussian kernel with σ = 1.5
pixels and Gaussian noise is added to create the mock observed image. This image is then embedded in a QPIE and reconstructed with varying numbers of shots to
create the reconstructed quantum images.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/epfl-radio-astro/QCRadioSimulator/main/doc/example.png)
